-------------------------------------------
IOCTL

255 different cases can be supported as part of the single IOCTL call

step1: figure out possible number of special operations possible on the device
step2:we need to create request command to access the operations and request command should be unique through out the all drivers.
step3: need to implement the ioctl function in the driver source and then provide a switch case kind of implementation for each of those commands and process those commands when the application used those API's to initiate the request


in param - application writes and driver reads
out param - driver writes and application reads

VEDA_FILL_ZERO -- no input required --> _IO
VEDA_FILL_CHAR -- in param --> _IOW
VEDA_SET_SIZE -- in param --> _IOW
VEDA_GET_SIZE -- out param --> _IOR

In coding -->
step1: verify the arguments
	ioctl decode macros
	_IOC_TYPE(cmd) - it will extract the magic number from the cmd
	_IOC_NR(cmd)- it will get the sequence numbers from the cmd
	_IOC_DIR(cmd)- direction 
step2: implementation of switch case
